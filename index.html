        <b><p class="custom-para">The graph illustrates the habits of people included in the study. Notably, the amount of people who neither drink or smoke is much higher, indicating that though smoking and drinking alcohol may make you a higher risk for cardiovascular disease, there are definitely other things at play here.</p></b>

        <b><p class="custom-para">In the depicted graphs showing cholesterol and glucose trends, it is clear that having higher glucose and cholesterol have an impact on whether an individual has a cardiovascular disease. It appears that cholesterol may have a greater effect on the patient than glucose levels.</p></b>

        <b><p class="custom-para">The blue bar graph represents the average systolic blood pressure (ap_hi) for each gender. On average, females have a slightly higher systolic blood pressure compared to males. The red bar graph represents the average diastolic blood pressure (ap_lo) for each gender. Females tend to have a higher average diastolic blood pressure compared to males. A recommendation would be to interpret the findings in the context of clinical guidelines and thresholds for normal blood pressure.</p></b>

The majority of individuals in the dataset that have the disease are 65.27% females as shown in coral pink. One recommendation is to conduct more in-depth analysis on potential risk factors associated with cardiovascular disease.</p></b>

        <b><p class="custom-para">The grouped bar charts showcase the distribution of various health metrics across genders. Systolic blood pressure (ap_hi) tends to be higher in females. Diastolic blood pressure (ap_lo) also shows a slightly higher average in females. Females generally have higher cholesterol levels compared to males. No significant difference is observed in glucose levels between genders. The prevalence of smoking and alcohol consumption is higher in males. Physical activity (active) shows a balanced distribution between genders. Cardiovascular disease (cardio) appears to be more prevalent in females. A recommendation would be to consider developing targeted health interventions based on the observed differences to promote healthier lifestyles.</p></b>
